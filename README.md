# Due to a lack of motivation to mentain this project, you shouldn't use this!
   You should use [Periwinkle's autosplitter](https://github.com/periwinkle9/smb-autosplitter#usage-instructions) instead! It has way more features and supported emulators than this one!

# LiveSplit AutoSplitter for Super Mario Bros!

## Requiremenets:
   - [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/)
   - [Nestopia 1.40v](http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/) or [Nestopie UE 1.51v](http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/)
   - Super Mario Bros FDS or NTSC ROM

## Installation:
### Through LiveSplit
   1. Right click on livesplit
   2. Click "edit splits"
   3. Set the game name to "Super Mario Bros."
   4. Then a message should pop up above your splits which says "Auto splitter by giffi", click the activate button.


### Manual
   1. Download the *.asl file and place it to a desired folder.
   2. Open LiveSplit goto -> Edit Layout -> Press the "+" button -> Control/ScritableAutoSplitter
   3. Double Click on the Scriptable Auto Splitter
   4. Press "Browse" and navigate to the downloaded *.asl file and select it
   5. Done!

## Usage: 
   When the script is active, the autosplitter will start automatically when you start the game, and it will split and the end of every stage.  
   Note that the end time will not be 100% accurate to the frame, so a recount will be needed if your run is fast enough.  

## Features:
   - Any% Support
   - Warpless Support.
   - Minus World Ending Support.

## Not Working?:  
   If you didn't get the autosplitter to work, try these following steps.
   1. Be sure that the script is activated from the splits.
   2. Redownload [Nestopia 1.40v](http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/) or [Nestopie UE 1.51v](http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/), if you download the emulator from an another source the version might vary enough to interfere with the auto splitter. 

## Contact:
   The entire auto splitter is made by a guy who almost knows what he's doing so if there's a bug or a feature request don't be scared to message me on discord.
